## Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„ in Rust!
This repository contains my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 Solutions for Rust.
Runs **all** solutions **under half a second** on an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (16) @ 3.600G processor!

Last year I completed Advent of Code (AOC) in [Haskell](https://github.com/Jellycious/aoc-2020). 
I really enjoyed the experience and decided to attempt this year as well.
This time getting my feet wet with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):crab:. 
Up to this point I was not really comfortable with Rust yet.
I attempted to create a fast (somewhat elegant) solution for every problem, without relying to heavily upon existing external crates.
At some points my code became pretty verbose and I think this is something I could improve upon.
Yet all in all I am really happy with the result and definitely learnt a great deal.

#### Running the solution:
I created somewhat of a framework to retrieve input files and descriptions from the advent of code website. Feel free to use it for your own Advent of Code solutions. See `cargo run -- --help` for the list of possible commands.
 
**Running all solutions:**
```
cargo run --release -- solve-all -b
```

**Benchmarking all solutions:**
```
cargo run --release -- bench
```
